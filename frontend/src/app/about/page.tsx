                Swastify was founded in 2025 with a simple yet powerful mission: to transform healthcare by listening to
                the people who matter mostâ€”patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

              <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                Swastify brings together experts from healthcare, technology, and design. Our diverse team is united by
                a common purpose: to make healthcare more responsive to human needs. From doctors and nurses to software
                engineers and data scientists, we approach healthcare challenges from multiple perspectives.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-zinc-900 dark:text-white">Our Approach</h2>
              <p className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                We believe in the power of community-driven innovation. By collecting and analyzing thousands of
                healthcare experiences, we identify patterns and opportunities that might otherwise go unnoticed. Then,
                we work with healthcare providers, technologists, and policymakers to develop practical solutions.
